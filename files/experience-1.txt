"People think living abroad means we’ve had the best life. But let me be honest — my childhood didn’t look like fun or freedom. It looked like being stuck inside a building, flipping through books just to pass time, because there was nothing else to do. No cousins down the street, no festivals with neighbors, no real sense of community.

I studied — not because I loved it, but because that’s all I could do. And even then, the grades didn’t always come. And when you try your best but still don’t see results, it messes with your mind. It makes you feel like you’re failing at life, even as everyone assumes you’re 'lucky.'

So when people back home look at me and say, ‘You’re so fortunate to live abroad,’ I don’t know how to answer. Because inside, I’m carrying years of loneliness, pressure, and a silent hope that one day, I’ll feel free too — not just from a country, but from the weight I carry within."
